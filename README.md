# Free Code Camp Solutions
---
## Bonfires
Alright, so I started writing out a collection of solutions for the bonfire algorithm challenges from freecodecamp.com.

Each solution is separated into it's own file and each solution is written with resources for concept understanding and a walkthrough to see how I approach a problem.

Surely you can copy and paste my code, submit your answer to freecodecamp, and progress to the next lesson... which is great, if you want to progress on the freecodecamp map... but not so great if you actually want to learn to program.

If you're going through freecodecamp and going through the lessons in hopes that one day you can be a career developer then don't just scroll down to the answer right away.

Let me walk you through some of the coding and the concepts, go to all the links, understand the concepts, then try a little more on your own, and then if you're still stuck go ahead and look at my code.

But do just that, look... you can even copy... but type it out for yourself.

I'm sure I'm not too much further in my journey of learning to code as you are, but trust me... it's worth taking the time to understand how these things work and way more important to understand these concepts than to just complete the lesson.

Good luck on your coding journey and I hope these walkthrough solutions are helpful.
